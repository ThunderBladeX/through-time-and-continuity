                            <h3>Classic</h3>
                            <p>The original DC timeline spanning decades of publishing history.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Golden Age (1938-1956):</strong> Beginning with Superman's debut in Action Comics #1, this era saw the birth of iconic heroes like Batman and Wonder Woman, and the formation of the Justice Society of America. Characterized by wartime patriotism and simpler storytelling, it ended as superhero popularity waned in the post-war years.</li>
                                <li><strong>Silver Age (1956-1970):</strong> Sparked by the reintroduction of the Flash in Showcase #4, this renaissance brought revamped heroes with science fiction origins, the formation of the Justice League, and the establishment of the DC Multiverse with Earth-One and Earth-Two. Known for whimsical, optimistic storytelling and campy adventures.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bronze Age (1970-1985):</strong> A tonal shift toward darker, socially relevant narratives. Stories tackled real-world issues like drug addiction, prejudice, and political corruption. This era introduced greater diversity and character-driven storytelling, culminating in the universe-shattering:</li>

                            <h3>Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985–1986)</h3>
                            <p>A 12-issue comic book crossover event designed by DC Comics to eliminate the complex, decades-old multiverse, which had become difficult for new readers to follow. The core of the story involved a cosmic, anti-matter entity known as the Anti-Monitor destroying parallel universes to rule over all existence.</p>

                                <li><strong>Zero Hour (1994):</strong> A soft reboot addressing lingering continuity issues. Hal Jordan as Parallax and Extant attempted to reshape reality, resulting in minor timeline adjustments and new "Year One" origins for many heroes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Infinite Crisis (2005-2006):</strong> Heroes from the original Crisis returned to challenge the darker direction of the DC Universe, resulting in the restoration of the Multiverse as 52 parallel Earths.</li>
                                <li><strong>52 (2006-2007):</strong> A groundbreaking weekly series chronicling the "missing year" following Infinite Crisis, focusing on second-tier heroes and expanding the new Multiverse.</li>
                                <li><strong>Final Crisis (2008):</strong> Darkseid's quest for the Anti-Life Equation threatened all reality, requiring heroes across the Multiverse to unite. Resulted in the apparent death of Batman and Barry Allen's return from the Speed Force.</li>
