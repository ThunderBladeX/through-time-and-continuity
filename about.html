                    <h2>What is this?</h2>
                    <p>
                        DC Timeline Archive is a comprehensive database tracking the lives, events, 
                        and relationships of DC Comics characters across every continuity and era. 
                        From Pre-Crisis to Future State, this archive preserves the complex tapestry 
                        of stories that make up the DC Universe.

                    <h2>Why?</h2>
                    <p>
                        DC Comics has undergone multiple reboots and timeline restructurings over 
                        the decades. This makes it challenging to track character histories and 
                        understand how events connect across different eras. This archive serves 
                        as a visual, interactive reference for fans who want to explore character 
                        development and continuity evolution.
